## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Q1
Answer the following questions with dplyr code in RMarkdown. Post the answer into your github as a “nice readme” as explained in class.

How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
flights
flights_1<-flights%>%summarize(sum(is.na(dep_time)))
```
## 8255 flights missed. Other missing variables are dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay, air_time. These rows represent that these airplanes are cancelled. 


## Q2 Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they’re not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.

```{r}
flights_2<-flights%>%
  mutate(dep_time=(dep_time%/%100*60+(dep_time%%100)))%>%
  mutate(sched_dep_time=(sched_dep_time%/%100*60+(sched_dep_time%%100)))
flights_2
```

## Q3 Look at the number of canceled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of canceled flights related to the average delay? Use multiple dyplr operations, all on one line, concluding with ggplot(aes(x= ,y=)) + geom_point()
```{r}

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
